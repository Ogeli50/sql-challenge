# sql-challenge
A new data engineer was hired at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company) for two weeks. The first major task is to do a research project about the company's employees during the 1980s and 1990s. Six CSV files remain of the employee database from that period.
For this project, I must design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into an SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively
This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.
For the data modeling, I will inspect the CSV files and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. For data engineering, I will use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files and import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.
Data Analysis
1.	List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
2.	List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees hired in 1986.
3.	List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
4.	List the department number for each employee along with that employee’s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
5.	List the first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
6.	List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
7.	List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
8.	List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
